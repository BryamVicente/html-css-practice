        <p>
            Thank you for having a look at this repo! My name is Bryam Vicente and I recently graduated from the Flatiron school bootcamp. 
            I learned various languauges and frameworks such as Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, Redux. I'm doing a training course 
            because I felt like there were certain topics that I needed to brush up on before applying to jobs. If there are any questions 
            please do not hesitate to reach out! My info is provided below!
        </p>
